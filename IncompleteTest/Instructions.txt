This is VS2013 solution. It has 2 projects: C++ MT and C# OPP.

In MT you need to find out if anything is wrong with the application and if so try to fix it. Note it uses thread_t class which is just a custom wrapper for multithreading API. See file thread.h.
In OOP you need to improve the existing code using OOP principles. Do whatever you think is good for this application.
Also there is a Problem.cpp file in this solutions. It has a description what has to be done.

Obviously the first problem - majority voting has multiple solutions. Please try to find most optimal.

The second one assumes that you need to compare very many numbers within limited time. So straight forward solution like Pow(X,Y) would be too time consuming. 
You need to  find better algorithm.
